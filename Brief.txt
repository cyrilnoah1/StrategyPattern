The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.

The following example project uses different types of 
bird classes with inherit basic properties from the 
Bird class, and then required additional properties are
set for each bird based on the type of bird being referred.
